"In early 2019 the girl I’d been dating for 2 years broke up. She was my first “I love you” and moving on felt like losing a part of my soul.
 A little while later I stopped by her shop one night to talk about some business-related matters, but we carried on the conversation past those. We just sat and talked for hours that perfect night and it ended with our first kiss in so many months. We tried to give it another shot not knowing what would happen. We broke up because of family disapproval and some disagreements that seemed so big then that we couldn’t move past. We didn’t know what would happen or even if we would make it another week when those problems came up again. One of our first dates back together, we watched this movie and the ending hit me like a gut-punch. I knew in that moment beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was going to spend the rest of my life with this beautiful, flawed, and perfect woman. It’s 2023 now and we celebrate the anniversary we got back together like our wedding anniversary or we will when when our first child is born in 2 months.","2","","",""

"The nimitz ufos are back, my dad used to work on an aircraft carrier (it was in the Atlantic near the end of the vietnam war), well in late December he died, i started seeing these in early December, i have not seen the crafts themselves only the lights, the reason i am thinking they are the same ones that were seen and tracked by the nimitz is that they behave almost identically to the ones from the nimitz encounters, the two differences are them being either solid orange or pulsing from orange to white, the other difference is that i have not managed to get a picture of them, there is a lot of light pollution where i live to the point that i can only see a few stars in the night sky, since the camera in my phone is broken i tried to use my gopro and i couldn't manage to catch them, yes that night there were only a few but most nights there are around a dozen, i am not sure if i just couldn't find them or they are using some type of stealth tech, i also dont have a way to do long exposure shots and even if I did they wouldn't stay still long enough, also i live less than 5 miles from an airport, it sucks that their servers are ridiculously secure, i would like to see if they show up on radar. Also I know it ain't the nav lights from a plane or helicopter both from their movements and them not being the right colors, also they are not weather balloons with flares, sadly i have neighbors who might call the police, if it wasn't the case i would take some pot shots at them with my dad's coyote gun, mind you its only a .17, sheet metal can stop it at point blank.

"Yesterday i saw something incredible, that i cannot explain. 
 I was doing astrophotography when i noticed movement in the sky over to my right. I turned to look and saw something i can only describe as 8 to 10 objects in a triangular formation crossing the sky at an incredible rate of speed. They crossed half the sky in about 3 seconds maximum. 
 They were all of identical size and all looked like dim balls of light, they were definately extremely high, maybe not even inside the atmosphere. They made no sound, had no trails, and were all white. 
 The first thing that came to mind was an asteroid shattering into severals pieces as it entered the atmosphere, but it couldn't possibly be that due to the triangular formation and identical size/brightness of the objects, nothing changed at all as they crossed the sky. I was completely speechless, it moved so fast i had no time to get my camera, after the object(s) disappeared i noticed several strange white lights in the sky, they would appear out of nowhere and blink two, maybe three to four times in sequence and then disappear, in several different places across the sky. They could very well be planes or drones, but it was still weird that they only appeared for a very short moment and didn't turn on again.

"According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago. World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.

 Methods
 In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).
 
 Trends
 There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

 You must do your part;
 Start not-using plastic anymore 
 Start buying drinks in glass containers, 
 don’t use anymore plastic bags, 
 don’t buy anything with plastic, no more plastic toys
 Buy wooden toys, toys without plastic 
 Recycling is just prolonging the eminent disaster
 Stop using anything containing plastic 
 Never expect that plastic problem will resolve itself 
 Love our planet and handle natural resources with respect 
 Natural resources, such as fish eats plastic too
 A garbage pile of plastic might be burned; 
 but now the plastic problem is also in our air and
 in your lungs and in the longs of your children
 Plastic in the lungs is CANCER, because it’s disturbed 
 through blood to the entire body;

"Right but if we don't even know how Coral REALLY WORKS than how can you know your aren't doing more harm? This is just as likely an end to humans. These aggressive business ventures tactics and Grant money buzzwords. Alarmist reactionary politics in science is as dangerous as any false miracle. If you can't sell em on heaven convince them of hell. They can't give a definitive number to how much of the world is covered in Coral (are they just going with 75%?) then how can you give statistics in such a way? And isn't so much of this geared toward a future of endless intervention? Without proof. Why aren't these groups striving to farm Coral? If you can't do that now than shouldn't that be your goal specimen. If it's bred can it be farmed? If it's farmed can it be an economy? If it's an economy can it change lives? Why not center being money and education and science to places like Guam(us military base btw) and study Coral. It's Attol- its all Coral no island. Wouldn't that be where help $ now lively hood later is most dire? I suspect there are lots of answers ppl don't want to confront. Like in Hawaii we ban certain sunscreens cause it might be suddenly harming the profitable Coral reefs, but don't wonder if it could be the 5000 ppl daily walking atop The bay. Or where all that banned sunscreen will end up. Or if this is something else like all the oil refinery and waste dumps the govt allows miles down the shore from the bay where it's no doubt the lotion in the water. Two years ago it was the spray on screen killing the ocean now it's the zinc oss. TBH I don't know more than any other persons who came to learn,but I found little scrutiny here(I believe in climate change btw) towards the irony of human intervention is the answer to all woe so let's sell it to the public. Nor frankly much hard science...how do you know what Coral stress is when you said yourself the natural time table is outside our allowed observational timeframe. I love they map the world underwater but that's a lot more of a business and art project which is fine just be real. This is propaganda for University funded cash.

Runoff land high it nitrites and phosphates causing algal blooms.

"🧜‍♀️ Hello, I’m late but we’re all late on this issue and better late than never. I’m a mermaid, and a singer, I’m dedicating all my future work and my life to these issues. The Ocean has always felt like home to me. It has been heartbreaking to me to learn how much damage we’ve been doing as people. I went to school and got my degree in Environmental Studies. There’s not much to see here YET, but I’m inspired in part by people like Hannah Mermaid, and I hope to swim in her wake. I’m based in the Bay Area. I’m currently investing in material for my Art Activism efforts, like a new mermaid tail to perform in. I drive for Uber, and I network and connect with people that way too in-person. Perhaps if you are in or come to the Bay and call an Uber we will meet! I will be working on sharing my knowledge and inspiration for leading healthier, more sustainable lives. Every little bit counts. Even small actions and changes make BIG differences. We need to reduce our negative impact and increase our positive impact. This is partly a moral and spiritual issue. We FEED into the problem and fuel this, when we feed empty voids with superficial material things we do NOT need. We do NOT need all the latest clothes, fast trashy fashion, toys, makeup, etc. bought online, wrapped in PLASTIC, and shipped to us. Try growing and making your own stuff, doing without completely, and seeing how LITTLE you can get by with. Instead of being prideful about how MUCH you can get, try taking pride in how LITTLE you can live with. You might be surprised how freeing and empowering it is, to learn how to say NO to all the things you really do NOT need to live. I must continue to struggle just to survive for a while longer, it feels like so many forces try to drag and hold you down. But...I will survive and I will be coming out as my singing mermaid self soon. In case anyone would care to tune in and support a new aspiring artist-activist ✨✌️💕🧜‍♀️🌊🌏","1","","",""

"The climate is changing and if corals can be helped with assisted evolution I think that's great. However there is enough evidence now that we know human released fossil fuels are not the cause of climate change. The issue around CO2 warming the earth centers only around nightime insulation provided by CO2 in a narrow band of infrared. CO2 caused climate warming computer models have vastly over-esitmated the nightime role of CO2, thus real temperatures fall way short of the models. The insulating effect of CO2 is measured in lab chambers of about 1 cubic meter to the size of a small room. Results from those measurements are plugged into the climate models and whoops, gives the wrong projections. But now we know better what effect nightime CO2 insulation really has, largely due to the mistakes of the modelers. The effect is surprisingly small. 
 
 Something else is jacking Earth's climate around and it could be more than one factor. Urbanization may be the biggest culprit, creating stores of heat in concrete and asphalt that are released at night. That, combined with solar activity and Earth's inclination may be most of the story. The noticable cooling trend, or slowdown in warming trend of the last 15+ years, even as CO2 release by fossil fuel use has increased, further exonerates CO2 as the culprit.
 
 Only in the last 5 years or so have some scientists found a way to measure the atmospheric lifetime of newly released CO2. The technology is a bit imprecise, but suggests a lifetime of about 10 to 20 years, meaning, all CO2 released more than 20 years ago has been reincorporated into carbon sinks such as the biosphere. CO2 release due to warming lags the warming, so warming by causes other than CO2 will increase release of CO2, yet still i's effect is much less than had been predicted.
 
 It is not just conservative 'Mericans that are not keen on fossil fuel reductions, but most of the world. Perhaps it is only in Europe, notably Germany, where a nation has somewhat greatly reduced it's carbon footprint India, which has some large solar power projects, continues to increase it's coal use as does most of Asia. India has actually overspent on electricity generation by coal and has begun giving electricity free to very poor people. This does not mean India is done building out it's power generation capability - it's a temporary oversupply in some regions. India and all of asia wants to reach electricity consumption parity with the West and is going in that directions as fast as possible. 
 
 White rooftops and road materials that do not hold heat is probably a good way to lower nightime heat retention, in addition to doing as much reforestation as possible since the green of forests brings nightime heat retention back into historical, pre industrial revolution perspective.","1","","",""
