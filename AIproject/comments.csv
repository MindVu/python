Dying light
Shitty game with shitty PS2 graphics.
damn left 4 dead 3 looks fun
So we’re throwing the whole stealth gameplay out the window then. This doesn’t look fun.
WOW this game is still HOT
First person makes this much much more brutal
"clicker: north
Gun: *points north west*"
This is fake
Now we just need a VR mod of Bill and Franks adventure
This is absolutely amazing!
Don't let the Resident Evil developers see this... looks great
Permission to show a mod what a joke you don't need permission for this unless it's from the actual developers a mod creator is a nobody
Oh cool. Generic AF zombie shooter reskin. Next?
Daaaaaaaamnnn...
Red Fall could never
Pretty cool not gonna lie.
Bill going to house on those infected with his machete
Now days you only need a pc and Xbox series x that’s all oh and Nintendo switch
The aiming system isn't quite on point
